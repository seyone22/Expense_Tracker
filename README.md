# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a personal finance application for Android, designed to help users manage their expenses efficiently. It draws inspiration from the popular Money Manager EX project but offers a modernized approach to expense tracking on the Android platform. Leveraging modern Android development practices, Expense Tracker utilizes Jetpack Compose for UI development and Room for database management. Our aim is to provide feature parity with Money Manager EX while delivering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

Expense Tracker currently offers the following features:

- **Account Management:** Users can create and manage multiple accounts to organize their finances.
- **Transaction Tracking:** Record and categorize transactions to monitor income and expenses.
- **Reporting:** Generate basic reports to analyze spending patterns over time.
- **Entity Management:** Manage categories, payees, and currencies to customize the app according to individual needs.
- **Automatic Currency Updates:** Expense Tracker fetches currency exchange rates from the European Union InfoEuro system for monthly updates.
